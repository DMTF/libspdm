  Copies a source buffer to a destination buffer, and returns the destination buffer.

  This function copies length bytes from source_buffer to destination_buffer, and returns
  destination_buffer.  The implementation must be reentrant, and it must handle the case
  where source_buffer overlaps destination_buffer.

  If length is greater than (MAX_ADDRESS - destination_buffer + 1), then ASSERT().
  If length is greater than (MAX_ADDRESS - source_buffer + 1), then ASSERT().

  @param  destination_buffer   The pointer to the destination buffer of the memory copy.
  @param  source_buffer        The pointer to the source buffer of the memory copy.
  @param  length              The number of bytes to copy from source_buffer to destination_buffer.

  Compares the contents of two buffers in const time.

  This function compares length bytes of source_buffer to length bytes of destination_buffer.
  If all length bytes of the two buffers are identical, then 0 is returned.  Otherwise, the
  value returned is the first mismatched byte in source_buffer subtracted from the first
  mismatched byte in destination_buffer.
