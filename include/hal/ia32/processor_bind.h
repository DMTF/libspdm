 * depends on if _WIN32 or _WIN64 is defined. The default if neither is defined
 * is the 32-bit version of size_t.*/

 * if we are compiling as 64-bit. This 32-bit definition then does not agree with
 * the 64-bit definition defined in libspdm and generates compile errors.*/

 * portion of libspdm.*/

* portions of a compilation unit (header files + c file), thus meeting the

* the <vcruntime.h> file in the compilation unit (and getting the right size_t).*/
